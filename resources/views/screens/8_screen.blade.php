                        We're developing the first decentralized application based on ET Protocol that
                        provides trustee services for the crypto world. You can use the dApp as is, or fork, customize, and white label it in collaboration with our development team for your own company.

                    <p class="font-weight-normal fz-1_2 lh-2_1 mb-5">
                        After ordering the dApp, all your company has to do is assign roles for your network of trusted parties (oracles) that will collectively administer assets and start working with the new target audiences.
